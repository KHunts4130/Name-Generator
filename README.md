# Name Generator

Time to learn a thing or two.  Let's put your name and nick name together in one place.  You're not Thanos right?!

## Specification

### Phase Zero

- Clone down this repository.

### Phase One

Users should be able to:

- Type your name and nickname into the input fields.
- When they hit the submit button, the name should appear in the `ul` using the correct semantic tag.
- The input fields should be cleared out after the item has been successfully submitted.

### Phase Two

- The submit button should be disabled if there is not content in every input field.
- The submit button should be enabled if there is valid content in the input fields.
- Add a button that appears when the name is generated that when clicked clears the display, input fields and resets the name generator.
